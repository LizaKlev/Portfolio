          I started as a Design Coordinator in a marketing team, then
          transitioned to UX/UI, and after some time started feeling
          unfulfilled, I tried JavaScript first, then HTML & CSS. It enabled me
          to design and develop my personal products. Nowadays Iâ€™m working as a
          Product Designer and do Freelancing.
